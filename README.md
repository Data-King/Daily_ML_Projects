This Repo is for anyone commiting to learn ML. Each day I will be adding a new project covering ML topics via projects.


I believe the best way to learn is through project based learning, the learning curve from learning ML is steep and the only way to get better is done by a lot of practice and doing projects while studying.

Any comments to improve are greatly appericatied.
